"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 1:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",1,FALSE

"went at dinner tonight at dhanmondi branch....food was good but I have question about the manners & etiquette of waiters. While I was waiting for my guest after reserving the seats, they asked me rudely as if my guest are coming or not they have other reservation (have to mention that only half an hour passed after I took the seats and half the reserved seats are filled already!!!). After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 1st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! If someone order food cost 200tk or 20000tk, both are your customers. You should give your staff proper lesson on manners then let them serve for your brand because its degrading the brand value.",1,FALSE

Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza.

"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",1,FALSE

"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",1,FALSE

Hakka- fusion of indian and chinese cuisine... And perhaps hakka dhaka is the most famous for serving hakka cuisine.... Orders their seafood platter and platter B... Wrapped prawn was certainly their blockbuster item and wantons played the Xavi role.... rice was decent but hakka noodles were bullshit... those were like noodles sold on carts! bbq crab should win the ballon d' or while steamed fish was may be the neymar of the platter! squid seemed to be paul pogba- overrated... chicken cashewnut was very good so the Szechuan prawns!!!,4,TRUE

The fried rice, noodles, wrapped prawns and whole baked fish was sufficient but there wasn't enough crab and squid. After I called and complained to the Manager, he sent complementary dishes of each.

"Me and some of my friends had iftar here yesterday. First, I called up Hakka Dhaka Banani to make a reservation and they didn't answer my phone 5 times until someone picked up and hung up on me before I could even hear them! Then they started declining my calls after I called them again! (How rude!) I called them again with my home telephone line... And someone finally picked up and took the reservation. Unfortunately, all the tables inside were reserved and we had to sit ...outside. It's not that special outside... doesn't have a nice view or anything... just a bunch of plants to block the horrid view. And the people that usually sit there are smokers who have their iftar with a cigarette. My main problem was the noise outside. Cars were honking outside and it ruined the entire experience. My suggestion is that they should just convert that place into an indoor area. The food was alright... But a bit overpriced. The Ramadan platter was 4K for 4 people. I think for that amount, they could've thrown in some extra dishes. The noodles was just average... Everyone kept saying it was ""cocola noodles"" I hope they take notes and improve.",3,FALSE

I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,1,FALSE

"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",2,FALSE

Restaurant stuffs delay in serving food specially when we order Platter items. They serve some of the main items after serving the starters of a platter so lengthy that the customers finish having starters when they still keep bringing some 1 or 2 items which makes difficult for the customers to complete whole meal!

Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 1300 for 2 person.. And here's what i think 1) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,1,FALSE

"No complain about food. Though the food was more on spicy side but taste was good. But you guys need serious improvement in your service and in your offerings. You don't follow what you preach! We were 11 people went to have lunch and picked your 299 set menu offer (circulated in your FB page). You had different options in the set like rice/noodles, beef/chicken etc. but the first thing you said everybody has to choose one item! why?? if so then why did you keep the options?? And later you denied 10% discount on women's day celebration which is clearly mentioned in your page. Very disappointing! These days people do talk/share. So you should be very cautious about it. Nobody will visit twice if you do not take care of your customers.",3,FALSE

"I have been a regular at Hakka Dhaka ever since the very start of their venture with their small restaurant at Banani. Ever since the very beginning they realized the fact that they might be the ""under-dog"" of the industry which motivated them to provide the most superior value possible which kept me coming back time and again, but this favorite restaurant of mine disappointed me quite a bit the past couple of my visits. I believe that in order to maximize the value provided... to the customers, a good service is as crucial as good food. Even though their food remains to be fantastic, it's their service that continues to frustrate me. It really pains me to say this as one of the owners is a good acquaintance of mine but even though the management is absolutely top notch, their service providers (a.k.a. Waiters) has some of the most unsophisticated and un-professional attitude and this just keeps getting worse. It is not always possible for the management to engage the customers directly, hence it is these waiters who end up being the face of the restaurant and it is not a pretty face. Please do not take it as a sign of aggression but rather a constructive criticism from a fan of the place. I am posting this here instead of a third party forum (such as foodbank) in the hope that the management takes notice of this issue. Apologies for the rant. Regards, Faiz.",3,FALSE

Good taste... Good Presentation... The mouthwatering flavour of the steak,5,TRUE
They didn't take Amex card. Got really embarrassing after we were done eating and I didn't have cash to pay the bill.

You better stick to Argeela for it Be ready to spend about 1k-2k per person",5,TRUE
The restaurant is okay. The decor is decent. The stairs are totally unsafe. The menu... it has a lot of flaws. Starting with the lack of fizzy drinks to not being able to order extra sides. Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark. I had expectations from this place and I am disappointed.,2,FALSE

"I had visited this place before, and the first time was satisfactory and for the price, they have a standard and likable menu. But as I'm writing this now there's a notable callousness from their part which can be something anyone is likely to face trouble with. I have had dinner with my family yesterday and took three of their current iftar platters alongside one sea food platter from their usual menu. The food was nothing special but it didn't lack taste either. The icecrea...m that was with the iftar platter was melted though. However, the issue that occured is when we were provided with the bill, the sea food platter stated 1597tk (vat excl.) This was startling for us as in all their menues it had 597tk written on it. When heading out we pointed it out and they merely apologised. My concern is that it is a restaurant's responsibility to correctly and accurately list down information of every item. The customers decide on a menu weighting down on both the price and food combined, an error such as this does not only put the customers at inconvenience but is mainly very misleading.",3,FALSE

"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(18th September 2015).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",1,FALSE

Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein.

The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 450/- BDT all inclusive.

The environment is good. Their food is very delicious and their service is excellent. Had their Nachos which is very good and I found it best when compared with other Nachos. Platters are excellent as well. Their buffalo wings and Nachos are must try. Reasonable price along with good quality and quantity of foods.,5,TRUE
"Seeing the location felt good about the cafe but they were renovating so very few customers which is why asked if they will be able to serve and the staff replied yes. To our surprise they served old and smelly chicken in their BBQ set menu to both of my colleagues and burnt mushroom to me one by one with serving the third meal 40 mind after ordering. Upon complaining they discounted 37 or 47 taka from the bill silently, which only shows they knew what they were serving and still went along with it. Very disappointing. Won't visit again and will suggest my Peers to do the same.",1,FALSE
Environment is too good for hanging out with friends and loved one. Food quality and quantity is just perfect according to the price. I guess they have the Best Nachos in town according to Price and quantity. Their mushroom items are must try too. Will definitely refer to try them again.,5,TRUE
Very bad behavior. We asked for a mineral water and they gave us a local brand (ps:never heard of that company) . The cap was broken and expire date was removed.

When called, the waiter told that it was a mistake and brought all the muttons together in a seperate bowl. Two pieces of mutton for each person and the pieces were very tiny. the firni was like baby food (semolina) and there was no raisin in it. Jarda was of no difference.

"I have been a regular consumer at KFC Gulshan 1 outlet. Today I have encountered a strange approach from the cashier. I ordered 2 pcs crispy Chicken meal. He was struggling to understand and eventually ended up giving two packs of fries. I told him that ordered the meal, there should be one pack only. Then he said you ordered 2 pcs of chicken. I explained it's the meal that I ordered. He was going back and forth... He seemed confused. I told a trainee standing next to him to ...call someone senior, the manager so that I can explain. She told the cashier instead. And he got agitated. He showed the fries pack and started saying you ordered 2 pcs chicken. The guy standing to him stepped in and took my order. He remained silent as he exchanged the cards... no thanks or apology for the confusion... nothing. To make it worse... he came upstairs after a while to clean up and kept exchanging eye contact couple of times. Don't want to put his name in public. Would be happy to inbox.",2,FALSE

On 16 February we visited KFC Satmasjid Dhanmondi branch and waited over one and a half hours. This is really deplorable service for a restaurant that claims to be serving fast food.

In addition the restaurant was very shabby and unclean.,1,FALSE

As rider was not available I myself came to KFC Paltan for 2 God father burger@ 400 tk offer. They informed me it's not available in their outlet. What's the point of such offer if u can't provide full information.

You can't just waste my office hour for nothing. Total unprofessionalism.,1,FALSE
