"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 1:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",1,FALSE

Well it is indeed one of my favourite restaurants in Dhaka because of the super tasty chicken and mushroom cream soup. But if I mention about the valentine platter particularly it was not really up to the mark! As it it suppose to be for two people but the rice given is not really enough for two people.

"went at dinner tonight at dhanmondi branch....food was good but I have question about the manners & etiquette of waiters.

After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 1st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! If someone order food cost 200tk or 20000tk, both are your customers. You should give your staff proper lesson on manners then let them serve for your brand because its degrading the brand value.",1,FALSE

They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza.

"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",1,FALSE
Good food and service..the employees were gentle as well...will love to visit more...,4,TRUE
"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",1,FALSE

First, I called up Hakka Dhaka Banani to make a reservation and they didn't answer my phone 5 times until someone picked up and hung up on me before I could even hear them! Then they started declining my calls after I called them again! (How rude!) I called them again with my home telephone line... And someone finally picked up and took the reservation. Unfortunately, all the tables inside were reserved and we had to sit ...outside. It's not that special outside... doesn't have a nice view or anything... just a bunch of plants to block the horrid view. And the people that usually sit there are smokers who have their iftar with a cigarette. My main problem was the noise outside. Cars were honking outside and it ruined the entire experience. My suggestion is that they should just convert that place into an indoor area. The food was alright... But a bit overpriced. The Ramadan platter was 4K for 4 people. I think for that amount, they could've thrown in some extra dishes. The noodles was just average... Everyone kept saying it was ""cocola noodles"" I hope they take notes and improve.",3,FALSE

I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,1,FALSE

Most dissapointing thing was that they don't keep soft drinks at normal temperature (wierd)....come on there are children!!

"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",2,FALSE

Food is awesome.. truly delicious! A Heaven for people who love hot n spicy Chinese food! Service is not up to the mark. AC does not work well. Restaurant stuffs delay in serving food specially when we order Platter items. They serve some of the main items after serving the starters of a platter so lengthy that the customers finish having starters when they still keep bringing some 1 or 2 items which makes difficult for the customers to complete whole meal!

Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 1300 for 2 person.. And here's what i think 1) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,1,FALSE

We were 11 people went to have lunch and picked your 299 set menu offer (circulated in your FB page). You had different options in the set like rice/noodles, beef/chicken etc. but the first thing you said everybody has to choose one item! why?? if so then why did you keep the options?? And later you denied 10% discount on women's day celebration which is clearly mentioned in your page. Very disappointing! These days people do talk/share. So you should be very cautious about it. Nobody will visit twice if you do not take care of your customers.",3,FALSE

"I have been a regular at Hakka Dhaka ever since the very start of their venture with their small restaurant at Banani. Ever since the very beginning they realized the fact that they might be the ""under-dog"" of the industry which motivated them to provide the most superior value possible which kept me coming back time and again, but this favorite restaurant of mine disappointed me quite a bit the past couple of my visits. I believe that in order to maximize the value provided... to the customers, a good service is as crucial as good food. Even though their food remains to be fantastic, it's their service that continues to frustrate me. It really pains me to say this as one of the owners is a good acquaintance of mine but even though the management is absolutely top notch, their service providers (a.k.a. Waiters) has some of the most unsophisticated and un-professional attitude and this just keeps getting worse. It is not always possible for the management to engage the customers directly, hence it is these waiters who end up being the face of the restaurant and it is not a pretty face. Please do not take it as a sign of aggression but rather a constructive criticism from a fan of the place. I am posting this here instead of a third party forum (such as foodbank) in the hope that the management takes notice of this issue. Apologies for the rant. Regards, Faiz.",3,FALSE

The wedges were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and the cheesy rice complimented the dish pretty well. I would also suggest their beef bento and their lemon chicken meal. Those are really good too.",5,TRUE

They didn't take Amex card. Got really embarrassing after we were done eating and I didn't have cash to pay the bill.

You better stick to Argeela for it Be ready to spend about 1k-2k per person",5,TRUE
The restaurant is okay. The decor is decent. The stairs are totally unsafe. The menu... it has a lot of flaws. Starting with the lack of fizzy drinks to not being able to order extra sides. Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark. I had expectations from this place and I am disappointed.,2,FALSE

"I had visited this place before, and the first time was satisfactory and for the price, they have a standard and likable menu. But as I'm writing this now there's a notable callousness from their part which can be something anyone is likely to face trouble with. I have had dinner with my family yesterday and took three of their current iftar platters alongside one sea food platter from their usual menu. The food was nothing special but it didn't lack taste either. The icecrea...m that was with the iftar platter was melted though. However, the issue that occured is when we were provided with the bill, the sea food platter stated 1597tk (vat excl.) This was startling for us as in all their menues it had 597tk written on it. When heading out we pointed it out and they merely apologised. My concern is that it is a restaurant's responsibility to correctly and accurately list down information of every item. The customers decide on a menu weighting down on both the price and food combined, an error such as this does not only put the customers at inconvenience but is mainly very misleading.",3,FALSE

"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(18th September 2015).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",1,FALSE

The place is situated just beside 3/a Dhanmondi lake, if you're a nature lover like me then its the perfect place for enjoying the soothing weather and gentle breeze of this monsoon. Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein. Being a chowmein lover I ordered plater 2 and I have to agree the food was great in quality and sufficient in quantity for one. The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 450/- BDT all inclusive.
